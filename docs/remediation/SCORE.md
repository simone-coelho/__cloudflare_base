# SCORE — remediation W16–W41

Derived by `scripts/remediation/score.mjs` from the vitest JSON report. No count in this file is
typed by hand: `--check` re-derives every line above the provenance marker and exits non-zero on
any difference. A W item is closed only when it has declared units, all of them are green, and
`docs/remediation/reviews/<W>.json` records a reviewer PASS at a named commit.

Units 39/45 · W closed 0/26 (W16–W41) · suite 1822/1907 · residual 85 in 10 files · typecheck GREEN
